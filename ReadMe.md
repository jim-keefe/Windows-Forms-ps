This demo has a window with tabs. Each tab has various controls of a certain catagory. As an example the first tab contains inputs such as a textbox, textarea, checkboxes and radio buttons. 

## Ping List

This is a very simple Forms example. The window has a textarea where the user can enter a list of targets to ping. Clicking the Ping List button will execute the ping on the targets. A gridview shows the results.
